# Common Lisp By Example

This is an experiment in collaborative and interactive learning being run at the
Springer Nature Lisp Club at lunchtime every Thursday.

Inspired by previous learning experiences, we're writing a book called _Common
Lisp by Example_ using [_Go By Example_][GoEx] as a template.

None of the contributors are well-versed in Common Lisp, but we feel that the
project of writing a book will help guide our learning, allow us to collaborate,
and provide a document of what we've learned.

The book is currently published as a website ([commonlispbyexample.com](http://commonlispbyexample.com)) 
and as an [epub](http://commonlispbyexample.com/common-lisp-by-example.epub).
