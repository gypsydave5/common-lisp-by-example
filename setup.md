# Setup

To start writing Common Lisp, we will need:

- an implementation of Common Lisp
- a text editor

and ideally

- a way to communicate between our implementation and our editor

## Portacle

[Portacle][PortacleLink] is a good quick-start environment for Common Lisp. It
includes the [SBCL][SBCL] implementation of Common Lisp, the text editor
[Emacs][Emacs], and the Superior Lisp Interation Mode for Emacs known as
[SLIME][SLIME].

It also includes [Quicklisp][QL], a package management tool for Common
Lisp, and [Paredit][Paredit], an Emacs mode which specialized commands for the
editing of the Lisp family of languages.

To follow these exercises we recommend installing Portacle.

If you're unfamiliar with Emacs, we've produced a [short bootstrap tutorial][emacs-tutorial]

If you intend to contribute to this project, or to teach using the exercises, we
also recommend [a few additions][addons] to the Portacle setup.
